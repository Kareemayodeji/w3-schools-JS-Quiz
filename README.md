# w3-schools-JS-Quiz
A clone of the w3 schools JS Quiz using HTML, CSS and Javascript

## What did I learn?

I really got a lot of insight as to how much could be achieved on such a little project. This project allowed me have a better understanding of defining and assigning variables, query selectors, if statements and, arrays. I also understand how to use comments effectively for proper documentation and easy navigation of the code. 

## Potential Future Features

- Adding adaptive features that give the user difficult questions when they solve easier questions correctly.

- Adding share features to allow users share scores on their social media profiles.

-Adding more quiz areas like HTML, CSS, Python etc.
